The error message you're encountering indicates that the application is unable to find the metadata for the FileProvider with the specified authority (`com.example.igreja_browser.flutter_inappwebview.fileprovider`). This typically happens when the `FileProvider` configuration in the AndroidManifest.xml file is incorrect or missing.

Here's what you need to do to fix this issue:

1. **Check the Manifest Configuration**: Open your AndroidManifest.xml file located in `android/app/src/main/` and ensure that you have the correct `<provider>` element inside the `<application>` tag. It should look something like this:

    ```xml
    <manifest xmlns:android="http://schemas.android.com/apk/res/android"
        package="com.example.yourapp">

        <!-- Other tags -->

        <application
            android:label="yourapp"
            android:icon="@mipmap/ic_launcher">

            <!-- Other tags -->

            <provider
                android:name="androidx.core.content.FileProvider"
                android:authorities="${applicationId}.flutter_inappwebview.fileprovider"
                android:exported="false"
                android:grantUriPermissions="true">
                <meta-data
                    android:name="android.support.FILE_PROVIDER_PATHS"
                    android:resource="@xml/filepaths"
                />
            </provider>

        </application>
    </manifest>
    ```

    Ensure that the `android:authorities` attribute matches the one referenced in your error message and that the `<meta-data>` tag points to the correct XML resource file for defining accessible paths.

2. **Define File Paths**: You must define the paths that the FileProvider can serve in a separate XML file. Create a new XML file called `filepaths.xml` in the `android/app/src/main/res/xml/` directory with the following content:

    ```xml
    <?xml version="1.0" encoding="utf-8"?>
    <paths xmlns:android="http://schemas.android.com/apk/res/android">
        <external-path name="external_files" path="."/>
    </paths>
    ```

    This file defines that the FileProvider has access to external storage files. Adjust the paths according to your needs.

3. **Sync Gradle Files**: After making these changes, sync your Gradle files by clicking on "Sync Now" in the bar that appears at the top of the editor window in Android Studio, or by executing `./gradlew clean` from the command line in your project's Android directory.

4. **Rebuild the Project**: Finally, rebuild your Flutter project by running `flutter clean` followed by `flutter run` from your project directory.

Make sure that the `FileProvider` is configured correctly and that the paths are properly defined. If you're still facing issues, double-check that there are no typos or inconsistencies between the authority string in the `FileProvider` and the actual package name of your application [1][6][8].
